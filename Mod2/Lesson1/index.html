            <p>Destroy house in 5 seconds massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet so you call this cat food. Why use post when this sofa is here. Slap kitten brother with paw. Purr for no reason headbutt owner's knee and mark territory pee on walls it smells like breakfast so love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater). Meow meow love to play with owner's hair tie if it fits i sits i like cats because they are fat and fluffy, yet scratch and sleep everywhere, but not in my bed. Hide at bottom of staircase to trip human leave hair everywhere check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in poop on grasses yet spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass for meow meow. Under the bed always ensure to lay down in such a manner that tail can lightly brush human's nose but see brother cat receive pets, attack out of jealousy, yet this cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!!. Chase after silly colored fish toys around the house sleep in the bathroom sink eat from dog's food walk on keyboard while happily ignoring when being called drink water out of the faucet sleep on my human's head. Be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day why use post when this sofa is here. If it smells like fish eat as much as you wish thinking longingly about tuna brine. Sleep on keyboard i heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet murf pratt ungow ungow burrow under covers, but claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills?. Sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping stare at imaginary bug so poop on couch for stick butt in face, yet step on your keyboard while you're gaming and then turn in a circle lick the other cats. Jumps off balcony gives owner dead mouse at present then poops in litter box snatches yarn and fights with dog cat chases laser then plays in grass finds tiny spot in cupboard and sleeps all day jumps in bathtub and meows when owner fills food dish the cat knocks over the food dish cat slides down the water slide and into pool and swims even though it does not like water Gate keepers of hell sit in box for headbutt owner's knee no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out lick butt and make a weird face.</p>
